# Goldulf: Excavation
It's goldulf back again! In GameMaker Studio!!

This game is a slight departure from the exact mechanics of the original, but will certainly maintain the spirit. You will play the game as a series of archeologists, starting in ancient times and eventually progressing through time and technological advancement, exploring the most dangerous places of the world in search of treasure and artifacts with which to stock your own museum. Amassing certain items will allow you to advance through time and play with more advanced heroes!

###Quick Terminology
* Player - the human being playing the game, also used to refer to a long-term playthrough of the game (see below). Consists of one or more (usually many more) playthroughs with various incarnations of the...
* Hero - a single in-game character, whose life will be regrettably short, but who will contribute nobly to the greater cause of the Player.
* Site - a place that a Hero can go to collect loot/artifacts.
* Museum - the place where the Player stores all of the loot/artifacts gathered by the various Heroes that they play as in one long-term playthrough.

Gameplay ideas:
* Can play as a hero with one of three focuses: brute force, stealth, or academics. Each will provide slight changes in gameplay.
* When a dungeon is completed, you will have the option of adding all loot collected to your Museum. 
* The Museum is saved at a "Player" level, meaning that it persists through multiple "Hero" playthroughs and deaths. 
* Once certain items (or certain combinations of items) are collected, the Player will have the option of advancing the Age of the permanent game. This will unlock more advanced versions of the Hero, but will also cause the permanent stash to be lost to Time! The stash will be discoverable in the game as a loot-heavy Site, but will have to be tracked down each time the age is advanced.
* Sites will be randomly generated - when looking for potential sites, the Player will have to learn the signs of what kind of loot can be found in a dungeon, as well as what kind of chance they have of surviving. 
* Actions are queued, but play out in real time. So every action will have a duration, and the Player will have to plan ahead a little. The number of actions that can be queued will increase over time, and queueing up a number of actions will provide slight time bonuses as the queue grows, giving the Player an incentive to plan ahead. The danger, of course, is that enemy behavior may not be predictible. The current queue can be cancelled at any time.
